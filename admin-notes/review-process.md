# Overlay 11: Review + Approve Submissions

This document explains how campaign admins should review submissions.

## Core Principle

**Volunteers do not get points unless they list the submission.**
Admins do not hunt for ways to award points outside the submitted record.

## Where to Review

- Visit `/admin/`
- Sign in with a Netlify Identity account
- Your email must be in the Netlify env var `ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated)

## Approval Standards (fast + consistent)

Approve when:

- The submission link is public and clearly matches the selected submission type
- The posting date looks valid
- Required hashtags are present (teams confirm in the form; spot-check as needed)

Reject when:

- The link is not accessible (private/deleted/broken)
- The submission is clearly unrelated to the scavenger hunt
- The posting date is obviously wrong or missing

## Notes

- Only **approved** submissions count toward **official** points.
- "Why I Support Chris Jones" is capped at **2 counted videos**. Additional videos may be approved but can score 0 due to caps.
- Streak bonuses and the 8-county sweep bonus are applied to **official** points only.
